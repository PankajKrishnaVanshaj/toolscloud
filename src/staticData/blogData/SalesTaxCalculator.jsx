      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        With countless calculators online, what makes ours the <strong>best free sales tax calculator</strong>? It’s the blend of accuracy, versatility, and user-friendly features. Here’s why it stands out in 2025:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        1. Tax-Included and Tax-Excluded Calculations
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Not sure if your price already includes tax? No problem. Toggle between tax-included (e.g., $100 total with 8% tax) or tax-excluded (e.g., $100 before 8% tax) modes to get precise subtotals, tax amounts, and totals. This flexibility is perfect for real-world scenarios.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        2. Multi-Currency Support
      </h3>

      </h3>

      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
