        Why Use Our IRA Contribution Calculator in 2025?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        With numerous retirement calculators out there, what makes ours the <strong>best free IRA calculator</strong>? It’s the blend of simplicity, advanced features, and real-world applicability. Here’s why it stands out:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        1. Inflation Adjustments
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Inflation erodes purchasing power over time. Our calculator lets you input an inflation rate (e.g., 2%) to see your IRA’s real value in today’s dollars. For example, a $500,000 balance in 30 years might only be worth $300,000 after inflation—this feature helps you plan realistically.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        2. Contribution Increases
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        As your income grows, so can your contributions. Set an annual contribution increase (e.g., 2%) to model rising savings, capped at the 2025 IRA limit of $7,000. This is perfect for projecting long-term savings growth.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        3. Detailed Growth Graph
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Visualize your IRA’s progress with a toggleable yearly growth table. See how contributions and investment returns add up year by year—ideal for understanding compound interest’s power.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">

        Inflation Adjustment
      </h3>

        Why Retirement Planning Matters in 2025
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Retirement costs are rising, with estimates suggesting a couple may need $1.2 million for a comfortable retirement in 2025. Key reasons to plan now:
      </p>

        <li><strong>Longevity</strong>: People are living longer, requiring more savings.</li>
        <li><strong>Inflation</strong>: A 2-3% annual rise eats away at fixed incomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Security Uncertainty</strong>: Benefits may not cover all needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Costs</strong>: Rising expenses demand a bigger nest egg.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        A <strong>retirement savings calculator</strong> helps you navigate these challenges by projecting your savings accurately.
