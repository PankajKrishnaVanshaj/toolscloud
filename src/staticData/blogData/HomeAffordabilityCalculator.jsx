        Let’s explore what makes this <strong>home affordability tool</strong> stand out:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Debt-to-Income (DTI) Flexibility
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The DTI ratio determines how much of your income can go toward housing. Our tool lets you adjust it (e.g., 36% means 36% of your income for debts, including your mortgage). This mirrors real-world lending, making results practical.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">

      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Loan Amount Formula
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Using the formula: Loan = (Payment * (1 + r)^n - 1) / (r * (1 + r)^n), where r is the monthly rate and n is the number of payments, the tool computes your max loan accurately—crucial for 2025’s high-rate environment.
      </p>
