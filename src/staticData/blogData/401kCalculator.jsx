        Why Choose Our 401(k) Retirement Calculator?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        With many retirement calculators out there, what makes ours the <strong>best free online 401(k) calculator</strong>? It’s the blend of accuracy, user-friendly design, and advanced features tailored for 2025. Here’s why it stands out:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        1. Comprehensive Calculations
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        This tool doesn’t just give you a final number. It breaks down:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Nominal Total</strong>: Your 401(k) balance at retirement.</li>
        <li><strong>Real Total</strong>: Inflation-adjusted value to show actual purchasing power.</li>
        <li><strong>Savings vs. Contributions</strong>: How much comes from your initial savings vs. ongoing contributions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        For example, a 30-year-old with $500 monthly contributions and a 7% return could see over $1 million by age 65—split between initial savings and contributions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        2. Employer Match Inclusion
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Many employers match 401(k) contributions (e.g., 50% up to 6% of your salary). Our calculator lets you input this percentage, showing how “free money” boosts your savings. A 3% match on $500 monthly contributions adds $15,000 over 35 years at 7% return.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        3. Inflation Adjustments
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Inflation erodes purchasing power. Our tool adjusts for this (default 2%) to show what your savings will be worth in today’s dollars. A $1 million nominal balance might only be $600,000 in real terms after 35 years—critical for realistic planning.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        4. Real-Time Results
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Change any input—age, contribution, or return rate—and see updated results instantly. This interactivity helps you experiment with scenarios, like increasing contributions from $500 to $750 monthly.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        5. Simple Reset Functionality
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Want to start fresh? One click resets all fields to defaults (age 30, $500 monthly, 7% return), making it easy to test new plans without hassle.
      </p>

        Young Professionals
      </h3>

      </p>

        Key Features Explained
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Let’s break down what makes this <strong>401(k) planning tool</strong> unique:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Compound Interest Formula
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The calculator uses the future value formula: FV = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) for savings and FV = PMT[((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1)/(r/n)] for contributions. Here, P is principal, PMT is monthly payment, r is rate, n is compounds per year (12), and t is years. This ensures accurate projections.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Inflation Adjustment
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Inflation is factored in using FV_real = FV_nominal / (1 + i)^(nt), where i is the monthly inflation rate. This shows your savings’ true value in 2025 dollars.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Employer Match
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The match is applied as a percentage of your contribution (e.g., 50% match on $500 adds $250). This is included in the future value calculation for contributions, boosting your total.
      </p>

        Understanding 401(k) Basics
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">

      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Tax Savings</strong>: Lower your taxable income now.</li>

        Common Questions About 401(k) Calculators
      </h2>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        How Accurate Are the Results?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The calculator assumes constant returns and contributions, ignoring taxes, fees, or market dips. It’s a solid estimate but consult an advisor for precision.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        What’s a Good Return Rate?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Historical stock market averages suggest 6-8% after fees. Conservative planners might use 5%, while optimists try 10%.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        How Much Should I Contribute?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Aim for at least enough to get your employer’s full match (e.g., 6% of salary). Maxing out ($23,000 in 2025, or $30,500 if 50+) is ideal if affordable.
      </p>
