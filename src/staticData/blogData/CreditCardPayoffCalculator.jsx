        1. Comprehensive Payoff Insights
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Enter your balance, interest rate, and payment details, and instantly see:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Time to Pay Off</strong>: Months and years until you’re debt-free.</li>

        Key Features Explained
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Let’s break down what makes this <strong>credit card debt payoff calculator</strong> unique:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Amortization Schedule
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Built with a loop that tracks monthly interest and principal, the schedule shows how each payment chips away at your balance. For a $5,000 balance at 18% with $200 payments, month 1 might apply $150 to interest and $50 to principal—seeing this breakdown keeps you motivated.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Extra Payment Impact
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Extra payments are applied directly to the principal, reducing future interest. Adding $100 monthly to a $200 payment could shave years off your debt, as the tool recalculates the timeline dynamically.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Interest Calculations
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Using the formula <em>interest = balance * (APR / 12)</em>, the tool computes monthly interest accurately. This ensures you know exactly how much you’re paying to borrow.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-700">
        Why Debt Payoff Tools Matter in 2025

        Common Questions About Credit Card Payoff
      </h2>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        How Does Interest Work?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Interest is charged monthly on your remaining balance. For example, an 18% APR means 1.5% monthly (18 ÷ 12). On a $5,000 balance, that’s $75 in interest per month—our tool tracks this precisely.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Why Pay Extra?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Extra payments reduce the principal faster, lowering future interest charges. Even $25 extra monthly can save hundreds over time, as shown in the amortization schedule.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        What If Rates Change?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The calculator assumes a fixed rate, but you can adjust the APR anytime to reflect changes, like a balance transfer to a 0% promo rate.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-700">
