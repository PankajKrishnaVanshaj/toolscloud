        Understanding Week Number Standards
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Week numbers vary by standard, and our tool handles both:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        ISO 8601 Standard
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Used globally, this standard defines weeks as starting on Monday. The first week of the year is the one containing the first Thursday (or at least four days in the new year). For example, January 1, 2025, might fall in Week 1 or Week 53 of 2024, depending on the day.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        US Standard
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Popular in North America, this standard starts weeks on Sunday. The first week begins on January 1, regardless of the day, making it simpler but less aligned with international norms.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Our calculator uses precise algorithms to ensure accuracy for both, handling edge cases like year-end transitions seamlessly.

        Accurate Week Number Calculation
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Using a modified algorithm, the tool calculates week numbers by determining the days since the first Monday (ISO) or Sunday (US) of the year. It handles special cases, like weeks crossing year boundaries, with precision.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Daily Breakdown
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        For any date, see all seven days of its week. This is built by calculating the week’s start date and iterating forward, ensuring each day is formatted clearly (e.g., “Monday, April 14”).
      </p>
