        1. Comprehensive Cost Breakdown
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        This tool doesn’t just calculate your loan payment—it includes:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Principal and Interest</strong>: Core loan costs.</li>

      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        For example, a $300,000 loan with a $60,000 down payment and $2,400 annual taxes gives a clear total monthly cost—crucial for budgeting.
