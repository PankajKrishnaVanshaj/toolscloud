        Why Choose Our Advanced Retirement Calculator?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        With countless retirement planning tools out there, what makes ours the <strong>best free retirement calculator</strong>? It’s the blend of accuracy, flexibility, and user-friendly design. Here’s why it stands out in 2025:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        1. Comprehensive Savings Projections
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        This tool calculates your total savings using compound interest, factoring in:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Monthly Contributions</strong>: Regular savings you set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Lump Sum</strong>: One-time investments or existing savings.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest Rate</strong>: Expected annual returns (e.g., 5-7% for balanced portfolios).</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        For example, saving $500 monthly at a 6% annual rate from age 30 to 65 could yield over $600,000—powerful insights for planning.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        2. Inflation Adjustments
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Inflation erodes purchasing power over time. Our calculator adjusts your savings to show their real value in today’s dollars. If inflation averages 2.5% annually, a $1 million nest egg in 30 years might only be worth $500,000 today—this feature helps you plan realistically.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        3. Retirement Income Estimates
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Wondering how much you can spend monthly in retirement? The tool uses a customizable withdrawal rate (default 4%) to estimate sustainable income, factoring in pensions. For a $500,000 portfolio, a 4% withdrawal yields $20,000 annually, or about $1,667 monthly—crucial for budgeting.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        4. Yearly Savings Breakdown
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Track your progress with a year-by-year table showing how your savings grow. This visual aid helps you see the impact of compound interest over time, motivating you to stay on track.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        5. Flexible Inputs
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        From life expectancy to monthly pensions, the calculator lets you tailor inputs to your situation. This flexibility ensures accurate projections, whether you’re planning for early retirement or a longer lifespan.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-700">

        Key Features Explained
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Let’s dive into what makes this <strong>retirement savings calculator</strong> unique:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Compound Interest Formula
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The tool uses the formula FV = (PV + C) * (1 + r)^n, where FV is future value, PV is the lump sum, C is monthly contributions, r is the monthly rate, and n is the number of months. This ensures precise growth calculations.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Inflation Adjustment
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Using FV / (1 + i)^t, where i is the annual inflation rate and t is years, the calculator shows your savings’ real purchasing power. A 3% inflation rate over 20 years halves value—vital to know.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Withdrawal Rate
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Based on the 4% rule (adjustable), it calculates sustainable income. For $1 million, 4% gives $40,000 yearly, ensuring funds last through retirement.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-700">
        Why Retirement Planning Matters in 2025
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        With longer lifespans, rising healthcare costs, and economic shifts, planning is critical:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Longevity</strong>: People live into their 80s or 90s, needing decades of income.</li>
        <li><strong>Inflation</strong>: Erodes savings, making projections essential.</li>
        <li><strong>Uncertainty</strong>: Markets and policies change—plan for flexibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Independence</strong>: Secure savings mean freedom in retirement.</li>
      </ul>

        Imagine Sarah, age 35, wants to retire at 65. She saves $300 monthly, has a $10,000 lump sum, expects 6% returns, and assumes 2.5% inflation. Using the calculator:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Total Savings</strong>: ~$360,000 by 65.</li>
        <li><strong>Inflation-Adjusted</strong>: ~$180,000 in today’s dollars.</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly Income</strong>: ~$1,200 (4% withdrawal).</li>
        <li><strong>Years Covered</strong>: Until age 85.</li>
      </ul>
