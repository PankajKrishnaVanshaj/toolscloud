        Amortization Schedule

        <li><strong>Interest Rates</strong>: Rates range from 3-8% depending on credit scores.</li>

        <li><strong>Taxes and Fees</strong>: Sales tax and registration can add thousands.</li>
        <li><strong>Down Payments</strong>: Paying 10-20% upfront reduces borrowing.</li>
