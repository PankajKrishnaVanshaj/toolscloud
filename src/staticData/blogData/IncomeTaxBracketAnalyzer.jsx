        Why Use Our Income Tax Bracket Analyzer in 2025?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        With numerous tax calculators available, what makes ours the <strong>best free online tax calculator</strong>? It’s the combination of simplicity, detailed insights, and user-focused features. Here’s why it stands out:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        1. Based on Projected 2025 Tax Brackets
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Our tool uses simplified estimates for 2025 U.S. federal tax brackets for single and married filing jointly statuses. For example, a single filer with $50,000 income falls across the 10%, 12%, and 22% brackets, while a married couple with $100,000 spans similar rates but with wider ranges. This ensures your calculations are relevant for the upcoming year.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        2. Standard Deduction Support
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Toggle the standard deduction—$14,600 for single filers and $29,200 for married filing jointly (projected 2025 values)—to see how it reduces your taxable income. For instance, a $60,000 income drops to $45,400 taxable for a single filer, significantly lowering your tax bill.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        3. Detailed Tax Breakdown
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Get a clear view of how much tax you pay in each bracket. For a $100,000 income (single, with deduction), you’ll see amounts taxed at 10% ($11,600), 12% ($35,550), and 22% ($2,250), making it easy to understand your tax structure.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        4. Effective Tax Rate Calculation
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Unlike your marginal rate (the highest bracket you hit), the effective tax rate shows the average tax paid on your total income. For $50,000 (single, with deduction), you might pay $4,750, or a 9.5% effective rate—crucial for budgeting.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        5. Downloadable Results
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Save your tax summary as a PNG image with one click. This is perfect for record-keeping, sharing with a financial planner, or documenting your estimates—no other free tool offers this so seamlessly.
      </p>
