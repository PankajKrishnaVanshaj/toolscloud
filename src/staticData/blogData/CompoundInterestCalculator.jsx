        Understanding Compound Interest
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Let’s break down the math behind this <strong>compound interest calculator</strong>:
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The formula for compound interest without contributions is:
      </p>
      <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded text-sm mb-4">
        A = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t)
      </pre>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Where:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>A</strong>: Final amount</li>
        <li><strong>P</strong>: Principal (initial investment)</li>
        <li><strong>r</strong>: Annual interest rate (as a decimal)</li>
        <li><strong>n</strong>: Number of compounding periods per year</li>
        <li><strong>t</strong>: Time in years</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        For regular contributions, we add the future value of an annuity:
      </p>
      <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded text-sm mb-4">
        FV = PMT * [((1 + r/n)^(n*t) - 1) / (r/n)] * (n/m)
      </pre>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Where:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>FV</strong>: Future value of contributions</li>
        <li><strong>PMT</strong>: Contribution amount per period</li>
        <li><strong>m</strong>: Contribution frequency per year</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Our tool automates these calculations, ensuring accuracy even for complex scenarios.

        Why Compound Interest Matters in 2025
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        In an era of economic uncertainty, understanding compound interest is vital:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Wealth Building</strong>: Small investments grow significantly over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Retirement Planning</strong>: Maximize savings with regular contributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Education</strong>: Teach the value of patience in finance.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Growth</strong>: Reinvest profits for exponential returns.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        For example, $10,000 at 6% compounded monthly grows to $18,194 in 10 years without contributions. Add $100 monthly, and it’s over $30,000—proof of compounding’s power.
