      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-700">
        What Is a Net Present Value (NPV) Calculator?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        A <strong>Net Present Value calculator</strong> is a financial tool that calculates the present value of future cash flows minus the initial investment, helping you determine an investment’s profitability. It uses a discount rate to account for the time value of money—because a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. Our advanced version also computes the <strong>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</strong>, the rate at which NPV equals zero, offering deeper insights into investment viability.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        In 2025, with economic uncertainties and rising interest rates, tools like this <strong>free NPV calculator online</strong> are essential for making informed financial decisions. From startups to corporations, understanding NPV and IRR ensures you invest wisely.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-700">
        Understanding NPV and IRR
      </h2>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        What Is NPV?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Net Present Value measures the profitability of an investment by discounting future cash flows to their present value and subtracting the initial cost. A <strong>positive NPV</strong> (e.g., $5000) suggests the investment is profitable, as returns exceed costs when adjusted for time. A <strong>negative NPV</strong> (e.g., -$2000) indicates a potential loss.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        For example, investing $10,000 with cash flows of $5000 annually for three years at a 5% discount rate yields an NPV of about $2387. This means the investment is worth $2387 more than its cost in today’s dollars.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        What Is IRR?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The Internal Rate of Return is the discount rate that makes NPV zero. It’s a percentage showing the expected return rate. If IRR (e.g., 10%) exceeds your required rate (e.g., 5%), the investment is attractive. Our tool approximates IRR accurately, even for irregular cash flows.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        In the above example, the IRR might be around 15%, suggesting the project outperforms a 5% benchmark, reinforcing its viability.
      </p>
