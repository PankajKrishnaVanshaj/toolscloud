        Key Features Explained
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Let’s dive into what makes this <strong>payroll tax calculator</strong> unique:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Federal Tax Brackets
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Using hypothetical 2025 brackets, the tool calculates federal income tax progressively. For a single filer earning $50,000 annually, taxes range from 10% ($0-$11,000) to 22% ($44,726-$50,000), ensuring accuracy.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Social Security and Medicare
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Social Security (6.2%) caps at $168,600, while Medicare (1.45%) applies to all income. These fixed rates guarantee reliable estimates for mandatory contributions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Dependent Credits
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Each dependent reduces taxable income by $2000, directly lowering federal tax. For three dependents, that’s $6000 less in taxable income—a significant saving.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        State Tax Flexibility
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Unlike rigid calculators, you set the state tax rate (0-15%). A 5% rate on $60,000 annually means $3000 in state taxes, adjustable to your location.
      </p>

        Understanding 2025 Tax Brackets
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li>10% for $0-$11,000</li>
        <li>12% for $11,001-$44,725</li>
        <li>22% for $44,726-$95,375</li>
        <li>And so on, up to 37% above $578,125</li>
      </ul>
