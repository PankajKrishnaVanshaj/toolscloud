        Common Questions About Net Worth
      </h2>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        What’s a Good Net Worth in 2025?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        It depends on your age, income, and goals. A positive net worth is a great start, but aiming for $100,000 by age 30 or $1 million by retirement is common for high earners.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Should I Include My Home?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Yes, include your home’s market value as a property asset and any mortgage as a liability. This gives a realistic view of your equity.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        How Often Should I Calculate It?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Monthly or quarterly updates keep you informed. Major life events (e.g., buying a car) warrant a recalculation.
      </p>
