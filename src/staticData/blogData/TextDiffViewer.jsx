        This <strong>free text diff viewer</strong> serves a wide audience:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-purple-700">
        Writers and Editors
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">

      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-purple-700">
        Students and Educators
      </h3>

        Key Features Explained
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Let’s break down what makes this <strong>text diff tool</strong> special:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-purple-700">
        Granularity Control
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The diff algorithm splits text into units (lines, words, characters) and compares them. A simple Longest Common Subsequence-inspired approach ensures accuracy, with a lookahead of 3 units to align similar sections.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-purple-700">
        Show Only Changes
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Filter out unchanged text to focus on differences. For "Line 1\nLine 2" vs. "Line 1\nLine 3," you’d see only "Line 2" (removed) and "Line 3" (added)—streamlining analysis.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-purple-700">
        Ignore Case and Whitespace
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Normalize text before comparison. "Hello World" vs. "hello world" becomes identical with "ignore case" on—perfect for overlooking trivial differences.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-purple-700">
        Why Text Comparison Matters in 2025

        In a digital era of collaboration and content evolution, comparing text is crucial:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
