        Understanding Capital Gains Taxes in 2025
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        To appreciate this tool’s value, let’s break down capital gains taxes:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Short-Term vs. Long-Term Gains
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Assets held for one year or less face <strong>short-term capital gains taxes</strong>, taxed as ordinary income (up to 37% federally). Assets held longer qualify for <strong>long-term capital gains taxes</strong>, with lower rates (0%, 15%, or 20% based on income). Our calculator automatically applies the correct rate based on your holding period.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        2025 Federal Tax Brackets
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        For long-term gains, 2025 brackets (hypothetical) are:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Single</strong>: 0% ($0-$47,000), 15% ($47,001-$210,000), 20% ($210,001+).</li>
        <li><strong>Married</strong>: 0% ($0-$94,000), 15% ($94,001-$260,000), 20% ($260,001+).</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The calculator uses these thresholds to determine your federal tax rate.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        State Taxes
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Some states, like California (13.3%) and New York (10.9%), tax short-term gains, while others, like Texas, have no state income tax. Our tool includes a selection of states for accurate estimates.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        High earners (over $200,000 single, $250,000 married) may owe a 3.8% NIIT on investment income. Toggle this option to see its impact—crucial for high-net-worth individuals in 2025.
