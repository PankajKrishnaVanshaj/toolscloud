00">
        Compound Interest Formula
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The tool uses the compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) for the initial deposit, plus the future value of an annuity for contributions: PMT * [(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1] / (r/n). Here, P is the principal, r is the rate, n is compounds per year, t is years, and PMT is the periodic contribution. This ensures accurate projections.

        Tips for Using the Savings Interest Calculator Effectively
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Get the most out of this <strong>free savings calculator</strong> with these tips:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Start Realistic</strong>: Use actual savings and expected rates (e.g., 3-6% for savings accounts).</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment</strong>: Try different contributions or periods to see what’s achievable.</li>
        <li><strong>Use the Chart</strong>: Visualize how small changes impact long-term growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Compounding</strong>: Daily or monthly often yields better results than annually.</li>
        <li><strong>Plan Regularly</strong>: Revisit the tool as your goals or rates change.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-700">
        Understanding Compound Interest
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Compound interest is the key to wealth-building. It’s interest earned on both your initial deposit and the interest it accumulates. For example, $1000 at 5% compounded monthly grows faster than simple interest because each month’s interest adds to the base. Over 10 years, this can mean thousands more—our calculator shows you exactly how.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) accounts for the initial deposit, while contributions use the annuity formula. This tool simplifies these complex calculations, making financial planning accessible to everyone.
