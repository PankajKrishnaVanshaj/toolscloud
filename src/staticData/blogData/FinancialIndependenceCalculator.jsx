        What Is Financial Independence (FI) and FIRE?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Financial Independence (FI) means having enough savings and investments to cover your living expenses without needing to work. FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) takes it further, emphasizing early retirement through disciplined saving and investing. A <strong>financial independence calculator</strong> helps you determine:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li>Your FI number (the nest egg needed to live off passive income)</li>
        <li>Years to reach FI based on savings and returns</li>
        <li>Projected passive income (monthly and yearly)</li>
        <li>Savings growth over time, adjusted for inflation</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        In 2025, with rising costs and economic uncertainty, a <strong>free FIRE calculator</strong> like ours is a must-have for planning a secure future without financial stress.

      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        1. Comprehensive FI Metrics
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        This tool calculates everything you need to know:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>FI Number</strong>: The savings required to live off withdrawals.</li>
        <li><strong>Years to FI</strong>: How long until you’re financially free.</li>
        <li><strong>Passive Income</strong>: Monthly and yearly income from your nest egg.</li>
        <li><strong>Total Savings</strong>: Your projected wealth at FI.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        For example, with $40,000 in annual expenses and a 4% withdrawal rate, your FI number is $1,000,000—clear, actionable data at your fingertips.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        2. Inflation-Adjusted Calculations
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Unlike basic calculators, ours adjusts for inflation (default 2%) to ensure your projections are realistic. This means your returns are calculated as real returns, preserving your purchasing power over time.

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        4. Real-Time Updates
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Adjust inputs like expenses or return rates, and results update instantly. No need to hit “calculate”—you’ll see how saving an extra $5,000 a year shaves years off your FI timeline.
      </p>

        Key Features Explained
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Let’s dive into what makes this <strong>FI calculator</strong> stand out:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        FI Number Calculation
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Your FI number is your annual expenses divided by your withdrawal rate. For $40,000 expenses and a 4% withdrawal rate, it’s $40,000 / 0.04 = $1,000,000. This is the core of FIRE planning.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Inflation Adjustment
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Using the formula (1 + return rate) / (1 + inflation rate) - 1, the tool calculates real returns. For a 7% return and 2% inflation, the real return is ~4.9%, ensuring accurate projections.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Savings Growth Table
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The detailed history shows your savings each year, calculated as: savings = previous savings * (1 + real return) + annual savings. This transparency helps you track progress.
      </p>

        Understanding Key FIRE Concepts
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        To use this calculator effectively, here are some core FIRE principles:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Safe Withdrawal Rate (SWR)
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The SWR, often 4% based on the Trinity Study, is the percentage you can withdraw annually without depleting your savings. A lower SWR (e.g., 3%) increases your FI number but ensures longevity.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Compound Interest
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Your savings grow exponentially via compound interest. For example, $20,000 saved annually at 7% grows to ~$266,000 in 10 years, assuming no inflation—key to reaching FI.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Inflation’s Impact
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Inflation erodes purchasing power. At 2% inflation, $40,000 today needs $48,600 in 10 years to maintain value—our calculator accounts for this automatically.
      </p>
