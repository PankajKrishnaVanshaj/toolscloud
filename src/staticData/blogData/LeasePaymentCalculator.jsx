        1. Real-Time Calculations
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Every input change—whether it’s adjusting the vehicle price or tweaking the interest rate—updates the results instantly. For example, increasing the down payment from $3,000 to $5,000 immediately shows a lower monthly payment, helping you experiment with scenarios on the fly.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        2. Comprehensive Cost Breakdown
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Beyond the monthly payment, the tool provides:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Base Monthly Payment</strong>: Depreciation plus interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly Tax</strong>: Based on your local sales tax rate.</li>
        <li><strong>Depreciation</strong>: The vehicle’s value loss over the lease.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest</strong>: Financing costs for the lease.</li>
        <li><strong>Total Lease Cost</strong>: Full cost over the term.</li>
        <li><strong>Residual Value</strong>: Vehicle value at lease end.</li>

      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        This transparency ensures you understand every component of your lease.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        3. Sales Tax and Fees
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Unlike basic calculators, ours includes a sales tax rate (e.g., 7%) and monthly fees (e.g., $50 for maintenance). These additions make the estimate more realistic, as taxes and fees can significantly impact your budget.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        4. Multi-Currency Support

      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        First-Time Lessees
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        New to leasing? The tool breaks down complex terms like residual value and interest into clear numbers. For a $30,000 car with a $3,000 down payment, you’ll see how a 36-month term at 5% interest translates to affordable monthly payments.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Budget-Conscious Drivers
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Watching your wallet? Adjust the down payment or lease term to find a payment that fits. Increasing the down payment by $1,000 might drop your monthly cost by $30, saving you hundreds over the lease.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Financial Planners
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Compare lease offers by tweaking inputs. A lower residual value (e.g., 45% vs. 50%) increases depreciation costs, which this tool highlights instantly, helping you choose the best deal.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Car Dealership Customers

        Understanding Lease Payment Components
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        To make the most of this <strong>lease payment calculator</strong>, let’s break down how lease payments are calculated:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Depreciation
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        This is the vehicle’s value loss during the lease, calculated as (Vehicle Price - Down Payment - Residual Value) ÷ Lease Term. For a $30,000 car with a $3,000 down payment and 50% residual value ($15,000), depreciation over 36 months is ($27,000 - $15,000) ÷ 36 = $333.33/month.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Interest
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Interest is charged on the leased amount, calculated as (Vehicle Price - Down Payment + Residual Value) × (Interest Rate ÷ 12). For the same car at 5%, it’s ($27,000 + $15,000) × (0.05 ÷ 12) = $175/month.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Sales Tax
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Applied to the base monthly payment (depreciation + interest), tax varies by location. At 7%, a $508.33 base payment adds $35.58 in tax, making the total $543.91 before fees.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Residual Value
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        This is the car’s estimated value at lease end, typically 40-60% of the original price. A higher residual (e.g., 55%) lowers monthly payments but may affect buyout options.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-700">
        Why Lease Calculators Matter in 2025
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Leasing is growing in popularity due to its flexibility and lower upfront costs compared to buying. In 2025, with electric vehicles, inflation, and new leasing incentives, understanding your costs is critical:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Avoid hidden fees with clear estimates.</li>
        <li><strong>Budgeting</strong>: Plan payments within your financial goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Negotiation</strong>: Arrive at the dealership informed.</li>
