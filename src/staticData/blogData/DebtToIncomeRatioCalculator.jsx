        Homebuyers and Renters
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Planning to buy a home or rent an apartment? Lenders often require a DTI below 36% for mortgages. Use this tool to check if you qualify or need to reduce debt. For example, a $2000 mortgage and $500 in other debts with $6000 income gives a DTI of 41.67%—moderate, but improvable.

        Loan Applicants
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Applying for a car loan or personal loan? A high DTI (&gt; 43%) could lead to rejections. Test scenarios by adjusting debt inputs to find a loan-friendly ratio before applying.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Budget Planners

      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Want to manage your finances better? The pie chart shows how much of your income is tied up in debt, helping you prioritize repayments or cut expenses. A 50% DTI might prompt you to tackle credit card debt first.

        Understanding Your DTI Ratio
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Your DTI ratio is calculated as:
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm font-mono">
        DTI = (Total Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Monthly Income) × 100
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        For example, if you pay $1500 in debts and earn $5000 monthly, your DTI is (1500 ÷ 5000) × 100 = 30%—a “good” ratio. Here’s what the ranges mean:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>≤ 36%</strong>: Lenders love this; you’re in great shape for loans.</li>
        <li><strong>37-43%</strong>: Acceptable, but some lenders may hesitate.</li>
        <li><strong>&gt; 43%</strong>: High risk; focus on reducing debt.</li>
      </ul>

        Why DTI Matters in 2025
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        In today’s economy, with fluctuating interest rates and tighter lending standards, your DTI ratio is a critical metric:
      </p>

        <li><strong>Loan Approvals</strong>: Banks prioritize low DTI for mortgages and loans.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Planning</strong>: A high DTI signals overextension, guiding you to cut debt.</li>
        <li><strong>Budgeting</strong>: Visualize income allocation to optimize spending.</li>
        <li><strong>Peace of Mind</strong>: Knowing your ratio reduces financial stress.</li>

        How to Improve Your DTI Ratio
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        If your DTI is too high, try these strategies:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Pay Down Debt</strong>: Focus on high-interest debts like credit cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Increase Income</strong>: Take on side gigs or negotiate a raise.</li>
        <li><strong>Refinance Loans</strong>: Lower monthly payments with better terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut Expenses</strong>: Free up income to reduce debt reliance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Use the calculator to simulate these changes. For instance, reducing a $500 credit card payment to $200 could drop a 40% DTI to 35%—a game-changer for loan eligibility.
