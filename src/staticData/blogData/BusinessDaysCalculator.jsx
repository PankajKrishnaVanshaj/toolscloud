      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Not every business follows a Monday-to-Friday schedule. Our tool lets you define your work week by toggling each day (Monday through Sunday). For example, if your team works Saturdays but takes Wednesdays off, simply adjust the settings for accurate calculations.
