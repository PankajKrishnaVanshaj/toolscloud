      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        1. Comprehensive Calculations
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        This tool calculates more than just future value. It provides:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Total Value</strong>: Your investment’s worth after years of growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Real Value</strong>: Adjusted for inflation to show purchasing power.</li>
        <li><strong>Total Contributed</strong>: Sum of initial and regular contributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Total Interest</strong>: Earnings from compound interest.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">

        2. Inflation Adjustment
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Unlike many calculators, ours accounts for inflation (e.g., 2% annually). This shows the <strong>real value</strong> of your money in today’s dollars—crucial for long-term planning in 2025’s economy.

      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Customize how often you contribute (monthly, quarterly, yearly) and how often interest compounds (monthly, quarterly, yearly). For example, monthly compounding at 5% yields more than yearly compounding—a feature that helps you optimize returns.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        4. Detailed Yearly Breakdown

        Key Features Explained
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Let’s dive deeper into what makes this <strong>financial calculator</strong> exceptional:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Compound Interest Formula
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The tool uses the formula FV = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) for initial investment and adjusts for contributions with FV = PMT[((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1)/(r/n)]. Here, P is principal, r is rate, n is compounds per year, t is years, and PMT is contribution per period—ensuring accurate projections.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Inflation Adjustment
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Real value is calculated as FV/(1 + i)^t, where i is the inflation rate. For example, $10,000 in 10 years at 2% inflation is worth less in today’s dollars—a critical insight for planning.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Interactive Chart
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Built with Recharts, the chart plots nominal and real balances yearly. Hover to see exact values, making it easy to compare growth against inflation’s impact.
      </p>

        Why Investment Planning Matters in 2025
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        In 2025, financial planning is more critical than ever:

        Real-World Example
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Imagine saving for a $20,000 goal in 10 years. You start with $5000, contribute $100 monthly, expect 5% interest (compounded quarterly), and assume 2% inflation. The calculator shows:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Total Value</strong>: ~$18,500</li>
        <li><strong>Real Value</strong>: ~$15,300</li>
        <li><strong>Contributed</strong>: $17,000</li>
        <li><strong>Interest</strong>: ~$1,500</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The chart reveals steady growth, but inflation’s impact highlights the need for higher contributions or returns to hit your goal.

        Common Questions About Investment Calculators
      </h2>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        How Accurate Are the Results?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The calculator assumes constant rates and contributions. Real-world returns vary, so use conservative estimates (e.g., 4-6% for balanced portfolios).
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Why Include Inflation?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Inflation reduces purchasing power. A $10,000 future value might only buy $8,000 worth of goods in 10 years at 2% inflation—key for realistic planning.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Can I Use It for Retirement?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Absolutely! Input your current savings, planned contributions, and expected returns to estimate your retirement nest egg, adjusted for inflation.
