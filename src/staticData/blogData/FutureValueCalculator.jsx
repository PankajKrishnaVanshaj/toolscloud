        Why Use Our Advanced Future Value Calculator?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        With so many financial tools out there, what makes ours the <strong>best free future value calculator</strong>? It’s the combination of accuracy, customization, and user-friendly features. Here’s why it stands out in 2025:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        1. Comprehensive Calculations
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        This tool calculates the future value of both your initial investment and regular contributions. For example, starting with $1,000 and adding $100 monthly at a 5% annual interest rate over 10 years yields detailed results, including:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Total Future Value</strong>: The combined worth of your investment.</li>
        <li><strong>Initial Investment Growth</strong>: How your starting amount grows.</li>
        <li><strong>Contribution Growth</strong>: Earnings from regular deposits.</li>
        <li><strong>Total Contributions</strong>: Your total input over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Inflation-Adjusted Value</strong>: Real purchasing power.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        This holistic view helps you understand every aspect of your investment’s growth.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        2. Flexible Contribution and Compounding Options
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Customize how often you contribute (monthly, quarterly, yearly) and how frequently interest compounds. For instance, monthly compounding at 5% yields more than yearly compounding—a nuance many basic tools overlook.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        3. Inflation Adjustment
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Inflation erodes purchasing power over time. Our calculator lets you input an inflation rate (e.g., 2%) to see the real value of your money in the future. A $10,000 investment might be worth $12,000 in 10 years, but only $10,000 in today’s dollars after inflation.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        4. Interactive Pie Chart
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Visualize your investment breakdown with a colorful pie chart showing the proportion of initial investment, contributions, and interest earned. This visual aid makes complex numbers easy to understand—no finance degree required.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        5. Real-Time Updates
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Adjust any input—initial amount, interest rate, or years—and see results instantly. This dynamic feedback helps you experiment with scenarios, like increasing contributions from $100 to $200 monthly.
      </p>

        Understanding the Math Behind It
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Let’s break down the calculations to build trust in the tool’s accuracy:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Future Value of Initial Investment
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The formula is FV = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t), where:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li>P = initial principal ($1,000)</li>
        <li>r = annual interest rate (5% = 0.05)</li>
        <li>n = compounding periods per year (12 for monthly)</li>
        <li>t = years (10)</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        For $1,000 at 5% compounded monthly over 10 years, FV = $1,000 * (1 + 0.05/12)^(12*10) ≈ $1,647.01.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Future Value of Contributions
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        The formula for regular contributions is FV = PMT * [((1 + r/n)^(n*t) - 1) / (r/n)] * (n/m), where PMT is the contribution amount and m is contributions per year. For $100 monthly contributions at 5% over 10 years, the result is approximately $1,589.51.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        Inflation Adjustment
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Divide the total future value by (1 + i)^t, where i is the inflation rate. At 2% inflation, $3,236.52 becomes $2,667.91 in today’s dollars after 10 years.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-700">

        Interesting Fact About Compound Interest
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Did you know Albert Einstein reportedly called compound interest the "eighth wonder of the world"? A $1,000 investment at 5% compounded monthly grows to $1,647 in 10 years, but over 30 years, it’s $4,467—nearly triple! This tool helps you harness that power.
