        Why Choose Our Savings Goal Calculator?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        With countless financial tools out there, what makes ours the <strong>best free savings goal calculator</strong>? It’s the blend of accuracy, flexibility, and user-friendly design. Here’s why it’s a standout in 2025:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        1. Compound Interest Calculations
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Unlike simple calculators, this tool factors in <strong>compound interest</strong>, giving you a realistic picture of how your savings will grow over time. For example, with a 2% annual interest rate, your monthly contributions earn interest on both the principal and accumulated interest—maximizing your growth.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        2. Dual-Purpose Results
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        This calculator answers two key questions:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>How long?</strong>: The number of months to reach your goal with your current monthly savings.</li>
        <li><strong>How much?</strong>: The monthly savings needed to hit your goal within a set timeframe.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        For instance, saving $500/month for a $10,000 goal might take 20 months, but if you want it in 12 months, you’ll see exactly how much more to save.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        3. Visual Progress Chart
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Seeing is believing. Toggle the chart to visualize your savings growth over time. Each bar represents your balance per month, helping you stay motivated as you approach your goal—no other free tool makes it this engaging.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">
        4. Flexible Inputs
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Customize every aspect:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-sm">
        <li><strong>Goal Amount</strong>: From $1,000 to $1,000,000.</li>
        <li><strong>Current Savings</strong>: Start from $0 or any amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly Savings</strong>: Set what you can afford.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest Rate</strong>: Adjust from 0% to 20%.</li>
        <li><strong>Timeframe</strong>: Plan for 1 to 50 years.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        This flexibility ensures the tool fits any financial scenario.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">

        Compound Interest Formula
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">

        Monthly Savings Requirement
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Using the future value of an annuity formula, it calculates the exact monthly savings needed: <code>(goal - current * FV_factor) / ((FV_factor - 1) / rate)</code>. This precision helps you plan within your desired timeframe.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2 text-blue-700">

        Understanding Compound Interest
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Compound interest is the key to growing wealth. It’s interest earned on both your initial savings and the interest that accumulates over time. For example, $1,000 at 2% annual interest grows to $1,020 in a year with simple interest, but with monthly compounding, it’s closer to $1,020.18—a small but meaningful difference that adds up over years.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
        Our calculator uses monthly compounding, making it ideal for real-world scenarios like savings accounts or CDs. Try adjusting the interest rate to see how even a 1% increase accelerates your goal.
      </p>

        Limitations to Understand

        <li><strong>Fixed Rates</strong>: Assumes a constant interest rate.</li>
        <li><strong>No Fees</strong>: Doesn’t include bank or investment fees.</li>
      </ul>
